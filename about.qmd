R represents categorical data with factors. A factor is an integer vector with a levels attribute that stores a set of mappings between integers and categorical values. When you view a factor, R displays not the integers but the levels associated with them.

Create a factor with `factor()`

```{r}
library(forcats)
f <- factor(c("a", "c", "b", "a"), levels = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

Return its levels with `levels()`:

```{r}
levels(f)
```

## Inspect Factors


```{r}
fct_count(f, sort = FALSE, prop = FALSE) 
```
